# Text-Preprocessing-Cleaning-Data
#### Tokenise data:

Tokenise means to convert long string of data into tokens i.e converting a string of sentence or paragraph to be stored 
as list of words. For tokenising we are using nltk tokeniser **word_tokenise** or **sent_tokenise** from NLTK library.

#### Stopwords Removal

Stop words are natural language words which have very little meaning, such as 'and', 'the', 'a', 'an', and similar words.
These stopwords are captured using stopword lib present in NLTK.

#### Stemming

Stemming algorithms attempt to automatically remove suffixes (and in some cases prefixes) in order to find the “root word” 
or stem of a given word
**PorterStemmer** and **SnowBallStemmer** are stemming techinque which are present in the nltk.stem library.

#### Lemmatizing

lemmatizing means to convert a word in its noun or verb form.
In nltk it is implemented using **WordNetLemmatizer**
